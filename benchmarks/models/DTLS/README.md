Contained are the hypotheses generated by learning DTLS client/server implementations using epoch as parameter.
Hypotheses generated for each experiment are grouped in a separate experiment folder.
Learning was done using a version of [RALib](https://bitbucket.org/learnlib/ralib/src/72de7940283a835fbe912f19eae09f4d29c903df/) adapted for running DTLS experiments, using the configuration file`config` included in each experiment folder.
A prototype version of [DTLS-Fuzzer](https://gitlab.com/pfg666/dtls-fuzzer/-/tree/71e00baef25ea59185f49b9659cd1e9d35f6fdb0) was used as test harness.
Learning run did not converge for any of the experiments.
Experiment folders also contain a timestamp information.
